## Create Data Warehouse

**Phase 1:** ETL using SSIS
The data was located on a traditional OLTP database which was normalized. We first created a database inside SQL Server for the data warehouse Then, We Write DDLs for the creation and joining of the data in **DWH**.

- We created star schema to show Fact table and Dimensions we ended having 4 Dimensions tables and 1 Fact table as shown below:
    - Book Dimension
    - Customer Dimension
    - Shipping_Method Dimension
    - Data Dimension
    - Fact table


## **Phase 2: ETL using SSIS**
### Using Slowly changing Dimension ###
### **Dimensions and Fact Table**:

#### **1. Book Dimension**

#### **2. Customer Dimension**

#### **3. Shipping_Method Dimension**

#### **4. Date Dimension**

#### **5. Fact Table**

## **Phase 3: Measures using SSAS**
### First we switched SSAS to tabular mode ###
### Then creating suitable measures using SSAS: ###

## **Phase 4: Creating Visualization using PowerBI**
    We have created a dashboard consisting of **4 pages** :

Finally, this is a tooltip to highlight the **main KPIs**:
